# ABE

my personal software development toolkit.

## What 

I always want a develop toolkit that only depends on system libc only, so this is. 


## Notes

* using c++ to speed up the coding work, but only class and template be used. no stl and other extensions. 
* ** NO libraries other than libc **

## Features

* fixed width types defines
* a very simple logging system and predefined macros
* wrappers of system time & allocator & ...
* a simple atomic class implementation
* a cow string implementation
* a reference counted shared object implementation
* bits reader & writer implementations
* a buffer class implementation
* a message(dictionary) implementation
* multi-thread implementations
* basic stl containers implementations
