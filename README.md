# MediaToolkit
my personal media develop toolkit


## What 

I always want a dev toolkit that only depends to system libc api, so it is. 


## Notes

* using c++ to speed up the coding work, but only class and template be used. no stl and other extensions. 
* build our own containers using template, @see stl/*.
*
